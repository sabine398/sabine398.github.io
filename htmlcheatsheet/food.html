		<h2>This is Hannah!</h2>
		<p>
		Her favourite food is the funnel cake, especially the chocolate flavoured one! She can never finish it on her own so she always eats it with a friend. Also make sure to ask for extra ice cream!

		<h2>This is CJ!</h2>
		<p>
		He likes all the food but he doesn’t have a sweet tooth, suprisingly his personal favourite are the baked cookies! They're yummy but even tastier when they are warm and gooey.

	<div class="box-3">
		<h2>This is Victor!</h2>
		<p>
		He can’t just pick one so he recommends his top 3! The corndogs, deep fried oreos, and the candy apples. But he suggest everyone try everything from all the food stall because its just that good!
